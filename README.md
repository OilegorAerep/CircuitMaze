Tandy Color Computer Graphics - Random Printed Circuit Maze

Quick and dirty "adaptation" of an MC-1000 (plotter?) routine that draws a printed circuit board like pattern. At first glance I thought it would be an Applesoft BASIC program judjing by some of the commands listed in the original source code (below).

The MC-1000 source was converted to what looks like Tandy Extended Color BASIC by an automated script/routine (not by me) and posted on the TRS-80 Color Computer Group on Facebook (October 2024); the poster of the conversion was asking 'how did the translator do?' so I took it to task and find out. Transcribed first as-is using the VCC Tandy Color Computer 3 emulator... it required some work to get it to run and display something resembling the original on the screen.

The logic of the line plotting probably needs more work. I do not have a reference on how the MC-1000 works so some of the decisions on translating the source to ECB were done on-the-fly; still the end result is an interesting collection of lines... I'll leave the challenge to someone else who might want to take on.
